# Forter-Home-Assignment

This is an home assignment I did when I interviewed to "Forter".<br />
The Full instructions to the assignment is in the PDF named "Home assignment - Claims",<br />
TL;DR the task was to read data from a csv file and write to json files after doing the requested manipulation on the data.<br />
To run and test the code, you should use the path of the file that is in the "Examples/Inputs" directory, This is should look like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python CsvToJson.py <br />
After that a request for a path will be printed and you should input `Example/Inputs/file1.csv` (that's the relative path to the csv file).
