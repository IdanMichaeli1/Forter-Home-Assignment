# Forter-Home-Assignment
This is an home assignment I did when I interviewed to "Forter".<br /> 
The Full instructions to the assignment is in the PDF named "Home assignment - Claims",<br />
Basically the task is to read data from a csv file and write to json files while doing the requested manipulation on the data.<br />
To run and thest the code, you should use the path of the file that is in the "Examples/Inputs" directory, This is should look like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python CsvToJson.py , after that a request for a path will be printed and you should input `Examples/Inputs/file1`.
